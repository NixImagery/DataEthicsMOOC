# Week 4: Money and Markets

* Algorithms and markets
* A World Without Money and Markets?
* Distributive fairness

The introduction to this week starts out with a new context: *the algorithmic economy*. Three questions offer a framework for our enquiry, presented as "fundamental ethical questions". The first, in my view, is not an ethical question at all but a political one, that of how wealth ought to be distributed. Either I still am not understanding the meaning of the word, *ethics*, or there is again revealed here the liberal dogma of the course-writers.
