### A thought experiment

We are tasked with making our own thought experiment to allows us to examine our beliefs and "surface" factors that influence our judgement. This is mine.

The question
: Is it OK to kill to save lives in a war when you are not a combatant?

Parameters
: In the context of war, it is given that the combatants of one side are allowed to kill the combatants of the other. What constitutes "combatant", however? Is it anyone who wears the uniform, or stands behind the barricades? What about observers?

The story
: During an African war, a soldier of an impartial peacekeeping force (soldier A) is invited to take a ride in a helicopter on a routine supply drop to a station in the bush. Soldier A has not been explicitly told that he is not allowed to ride in the vehicles of either side. The route is a well-known safe corridor, well policed by peacekeepers and resepcted by both sides in the war. Soldier A takes the ride, seated in the open side door of the helicopter next to a mounted cannon. En route, the helicopter comes under fire unexpectedly. The pilot takes evasive action by banking sharply to right. Soldier A can see smoke coming from a group of boulders on the ground directly in front of him. He realises that his life, and the lives of the others in the helicopter are in danger. He hears the pilot on the intercom shouting, "Shoot them! Shoot them!" 

: **You are soldier A. Do you use the cannon and try to save yourself and the crew?**
