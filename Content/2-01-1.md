### Algorithms and mathematical models

This section provides example cases of "algorithmic bias" in welfare services that are in part computerised. Interestingly, it doesn't mention China's [Social Credit System](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/chinese-government-social-credit-score-privacy-invasion) which "rates" individuals according to trustworthiness: participation in the system became mandatory this year for Chinese citizens. Social Credit is economic and social reputation of individuals and business entities. Reputation is earned and lost by behaviours: good acts like giving blood or doing voluntary work are positive, bad acts like jaywalking, using your sister's transit ID card, jumping a red light, are negative. Credit determines how accessible services and rights are to you: university places, hospital procedures, employment, and so on. Untrustworthy citizens are posted on social media channels and posters.
