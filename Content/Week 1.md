# Week 1: Ethics and Law

## Section 1 Ethical 'Issues'

This starts with some housekeeping, introductions to the tutors and setting up a profile within the course. Then, Ewa gets us started by considering a "broad overview" of **ethics**, using a radio interview about the Cambridge Analytica (CA) scandal as a resource to get us thinking.

In the clip, problematised issues with the CA matter included:

* the way data was gathered from people
* the fact that the data was then passed on to another party 
* that the data was now available for commercial use
* that the data was used for political purpose
* the FaceBook (FB) login on an app gave permissions for all of users' FB data to be used and shared
* people aren't outraged, or even bothered by this enough to take action

Discussion forum task
: Think back over your professional life and identify one example of an ethical issue that you personally experienced. In the discussion forum, write a brief summary (around 50-100 words) describing this issue - try to explain the context, what happened, and why you felt it was an ethical issue. After you've done this, comment on two other posts.

I had to take a quick look at the forum first to gauge the level of ethical matters that were being shared. There seems to be a discernible difference between **moral**, **legal**  and **ethical** matters in the revelations on the forum. My own example came from quite a selection of professional experience that ranged from legal but immoral, moral but illegal, unethical but moral and legal. I picked an example from a while back.

> I was project manager in a business that made flight crew training simulators. These devices were multi-million-dollar complex machines that used specially designed and manufactured circuit boards mounted in standard racks to drive the various components of the device. I had an internal review one morning that failed badly when the equipment that had been working well the night before suddenly failed to function. It was extremely embarrassing for my team. We discovered later that day that in the night, another project manager had switched a key circuit board for a faulty one from his own machine.

The other examples I commented on or read seemed to me to be not so much ethical issues as difficult choices or situations. This is causing me to wonder if I have a secure understanding of the term, "ethical". Hopefully the next section will clear that up for me.
