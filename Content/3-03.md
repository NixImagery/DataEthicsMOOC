## Design Solutions

> *This is what this course aims to do: encourage you to reflect how your design choices can shape your users and society.*

I think I am beginning to see the aims and purposes of this course more clearly: to help us see what is in plain sight and already in our experience, although forgotten. Systems are powerful in that they influence behaviour of those who interact with them. Culture is a system in this regard, therefore. Societal norms have aye been manipulated by those who seek power: the information media have been crucial in adjusting those norms. Today's situation is no different: truth is hidden to enhance the message, whether for marketing or political ends. The defence is simple enough: to be informed, and to be educated[^note-3-03-1].

[^note-3-03-1]: I'm not talking about education in the school or systemic sense here. I mean that to be educated is to know much, to have read much, travelled much and thought much about events, most particularly those of recent history. Sound technical knowledge is included in that definition too.
