## The IoT

The Internet of Things is growing rapidly worldwide and quite possibly more so under the pandemic because of the shift to online shopping it has driven. Industrial infrastructure is enhanced by data and the greater data association with objects. According to IoT Analytics (a market research firm), manufacturing leads in the application of these technology advances. [@IoTAnalytics2020].

Smart cities are the stimulus for the first discussion in the forum this week. A video clip sets out the possibilities and the pitfalls[^scslink].

### Activity: what do you think are the biggest concerns raised by the Internet of Things?

For me, there is clearly the potential for the abuse of power. Surveillance by digital means is less visible but no less terrifying than Goebbels' yellow badge.

### Hammer Chewers
A further video introduces further the IoT using a "two people pretend to interview each other" approach which is a bit cheesy, especially as neither are natural presenters. I'm finding the pedagogy of this course fascinating: for a University which has a School of Education, it's eye-rolling (face-palming?) to see academics who think they know how to teach, actually try. To be fair, it's not unique to Edinburgh: this problem presents itself in other courses I have seen. It's a delighfully ironic example of Dunning-Krueger [@Kruger1999].

### So, what is it?

Imagine the world in the age of the new telegraph. Messages can be sent from place to place, if those places are connected by wires. Add to this, the technological advances in sensing the environment, and we have *telemetry*. The ability and desire to save our legs has been the driver of innovation: the [Trojan Room Coffee Pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot) is a legendary modern example. Now, the Internet provides the wires for communication, and miniaturisation and scaling of sensors provides a deluge of data. The IoT is not a new thing at all, merely the development of something much older. It is telemetry, but with the added bonus of aggregation and inference: analysis of increasing amounts of data from the physical world yields insights we didn't have before.

What makes it interesting is the development of the neural network and the inferences they can make from many data points. Inferences that can aid policy and management decisions (like, "do we need street lights on in this district between 2 am and 4 am?"). Inferences like "these districts are more prone to drug crime".

What is described as the datafication of the environment is surely an exaggeration, but the more we know about the world, then so must our choices be improved?

The problems arise when data is re-purposed. This problem is also identified as *function creep*. Steps are being taken now to make it harder for this re-purposing of data to happen without the provider of the data having informed awareness, and giving their informed consent for it to be used in a new or different way than was understood. "Doing data protection by design and default" is mentioned in the video to suggest that limits can be placed on the use of the data when innovation is taking place.
