The situation is set out for us: we are using technologies, sometimes without having the right to refuse, which are gathering data on us, our homes, and our lives. The ethical concerns associated with these innovations are characterised as being of two kinds: *Social and cultural concerns*; and *Governance concerns*.

### Audit and share

Students on the course are invited to consider and share their thoughts on the risks and benefits of smart devices. We are challenged to consider the security measures we (may) have taken to protect privacy as we use them.

I did an audit of my home and consider it not to be so smart: we have wifi, of course, with an up to date firewall and port management; an Amazon Fire Stick on one of the stupid TVs to make it smarter; an Amazon Echo Dot that is just hilarious[^note-3-01-1], that we got free with the Hive device for the boiler.
