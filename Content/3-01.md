The situation is set out for us: we are using technologies, sometimes without having the right to refuse, which are gathering data on us, our homes, and our lives. The ethical concerns associated with these innovations are characterised as being of two kinds: *Social and cultural concerns*; and *Governance concerns*.

### Audit and share

Students on the course are invited to consider and share their thoughts on the risks and benefits of smart devices. We are challenged to consider the security measures we (may) have taken to protect privacy as we use them.

I did an audit of my home and consider it not to be so smart: we have wifi, of course, with an up to date firewall and port management; an Amazon Fire Stick on one of the stupid TVs to make it smarter; an Amazon Echo Dot that is just hilarious[^note-3-01-1], that we got free with the Hive device for the boiler.

[^note-3-01-1]: Try the extreme farts extension pack for Alexa.

### Governance

Laws like GDPR address concerns like *opaque data flows*, where data is moved around and shared within systems without the awareness of the people using those systems. These laws try to ensure that users are informed about these data flows and have some sense of choice, although it is evident that these mechanisms fail: they are themselves opaque and inaccessible to users. A modern defence is obfuscation -- burying it with bureaucracy -- and one which organisations use extensively to hold up a veil of compliance and transfer blame to the participants or users who are too lazy to fill the forms in, or read the Ts & Cs[^note-3-01-2].

[^note-3-01-2]: This particular problem is causing me considerable difficulty at the moment. Systems purported to support staff and students are in fact stressors because they present a wall of undifferentiated administration where none is required, or at least, a minimal set and some principles that, once clearly stated, are all those staff and students need to decide for themselves how to comply with  requirements. It's incompetence but because it is presented as "action in support", nothing is done about it and those who speak out are seen to be oppugnant. One has empathy with [Lord Altrincham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grigg_(writer)).

Academics write that privacy involves protecting the *context* of data as much as the data itself.

### Examples activity
We are encouraged to "share and comment" on a [Padlet](https://padlet.com/moocdeliveryteam/m6er1x8gmb8t6b2j) articles relating to four examples: internet-connected home systems; smart homes for the elderly; Alexa/Echo; and smart meters[^note-3-01-3]. 

[^note-3-01-3]: Apart from my hatred of Padlet and similar "digital equivalents to something useful", I am too short of time for this. The time estimate for this course is way off the 3 hours a week for a full engagement with it and I am a little frustrated by not being able to dive into the wider reading. I really wanted to look at Danah Boyd's paper on teenagers' engagement with technology but that will have to just pass me by. This is not a criticism of the course, but of my own stupidity in engaging with it at this time.
