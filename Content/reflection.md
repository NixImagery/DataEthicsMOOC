# A reflection

I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this course[^ref-imho]. It is cack-handed and lazy, pedagogically speaking, but worse, *much worse* than that, it is a pretence, either ignorant and na√Øve, or with political intent. It feigns academic authority: it is presented by learned people keeping straight faces in the dispassionate, disconnected, and disinterested way that proper scientists do. However, [early in the course](#human-ai-interaction) the unexpected amnesia appears, [followed quickly](#common-ethical-issues) by the implicit claim to moral authority by the course writers. This is either just very bad science or supreme arrogance. Further examples[^ex-1] chip away at what is left of the credibility of this course until [the great reveal of the Marxist meme](#week-4-money-and-markets), offered as a principle, no less. For me, at this point, trust is betrayed, not just in the course, but also the team that present it, and perhaps even the University and bodies they represent. This is disappointing.

### Will I be back for another MOOC?

Not likely, and certainly not another University of Edinburgh one. If I need professional teaching, then I will get a professional teacher in, or do it myself, like the plumbing.

### A wider problem

I occasionally refer to "the socialist republic of Moray House" when observing the  left-wing stance of colleagues in the part of the University I know best. It seems that such socialist leanings may not be confined to the social sciences, although this course is more social science than it is real science, and therein, maybe, lies the problem. Despite warnings [@Horgan2013], social researchers still wade into deep waters where they are not equipped to go: morality and ethics are possibly the last place they should be allowed to wield their sickles in case they cut themselves.

[^ref-imho]: I even paid the certificate fee, to support open learning, as we all who can afford it, have an ethical duty to do, in my humble opinion. I blustered in rage through the rest of the course, angry at several things. Of course, I didn't make the 4/6 pass mark. I hadn't really studied the week 5 materials.

[^ex-1]: [Here](#predicitve-policing), [here](#automating-poverty-task), [here](#bias), for example.
