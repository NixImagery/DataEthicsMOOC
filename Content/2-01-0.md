### Predictive policing

Another talking head, this time revealing the extent of the use of technology in policing in the UK, as reported by the leftist lobby group NCCL[^shami][@Couchman2019]. Here, the media response to the use of AI to predict things like potential hot-spots for new crime, or even potential criminal behaviour of individual citizens, is noted. They made links to the Hollywood Film, "Minority Report" which was based on a similar theme.

The fear is that existing (negative) biases will be amplified: this is ceratinly a resonable fear and hinges on the data that is used to train the machines, which must be historical data.

What the video fails to do is to identify this report's finding that predictive policing is not in use (and has not been used) in Scotland or Northern Ireland. I found that odd, as the presenter described the report as being "*about the rise of predictive policing across the UK*."

The attraction for police forces is clear: greater efficiency in the deployment of sparse resources is a desirable feature of any publicly-funded service. Similarly, benefit and social work agencies have the same gains to make, and the different application of deciding fair and consistent sentencing in the criminal courts is also clearly desirable *if it is sound.* That requires awareness of the full feature set of the data used to train the systems and the ability to compensate for errors by the application of appropriate weightings or bias.
