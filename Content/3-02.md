## The Smart City

This section begins with some illustrations of "smart" city projects that have fallen on their faces through inadequate understanding of the people they pretend to be for. It seems that the planners' model of urban society is hugely over-simplified in these examples, which in turn is the cause of their failure to flourish. Investors and citizens alike seem to be highly circumspect when it comes to *controlled surveillance*. This, notwithstanding the success of infection-beating systems rolled out to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

A couple of lazy "discuss it amongst yourselves" tasks ask us to tell each other what it's like in your country and to stand in moral judgment of the "millennial app" Waze (I'm paraphrasing the discussions I read). Much of it was of the quality of an average FaceBook spat between rednecks and liberals.

What strikes me is the length of time it has taken for society to adopt the technologies we have had for decades: I was using GIS and SGML in the 1980s and yet it has taken until the 2020s for the potential to be noticed, yet alone realised. The Chinese aren't too squeamish to roll their sleeves up and get stuck in whilst the rest of the world pauses as the edge of the pool pondering how cold the water might be or if there might be crocodiles. I admire them for that. It will take a significant shift away from individualistic liberal democracy to make much use of these possibilities.

The *Design Solutions* section of this week's course opens with the above statement: a flat assertion of a dogmatic liberal stance, made with neither apology nor justification. We have already seen that people don't care about privacy until it results in some perceived injustice. They care even less when the systems are transparent: they care when the conveniences they have become used to are denied.

### Facial recognition

How far is too far, though? The course asks whether facial recognition technology and its use by police is acceptable. Protesters are worried that it has no precedent because the term, "facial recognition" doesn't appear in Statute and that this makes its use unregulated and unlimited. This appears to be a false argument, because the technology is merely amplifying the existing capacity of the police to recognise known persons of interest. What does seem very British in one of the clips is the fining of one poor man who covered his face up in a surveillance trial in London and landed himself a Â£90 fine. They wouldn't have slapped that penalty on a woman wearing a *burqa* -- this seems to be an example of the police abusing the "disorderly conduct" laws in the same way that any British Army NCO can abuse Section 19 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 (formerly Section 69 of the Army Act 1955), "conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline"[^note-3-02-1].

[^note-3-02-1]: Ben Brayne, one time RSM at Depot REME, Arborfield, famously jailed both his dog and his pace stick for misdemeanours on the parade ground.

What's the beef, though? There's a difference between getting all itchy about being recognised in a public place, and on private property. One of our great freedoms is to be able take a photograph of people in public. Many people who have become used to some sense of a "right to privacy" in recent times will take offence (for surely offence is always taken, never given) if you snap them on the high street. I don't see why.
