### Values

What we value in society is a cultural attribute. Values are therefore dependent on context and are not absolute: I have often said that every principle has a price attached to it, and that if the price is right, all principles are for sale. This has caused strong reaction when vocalised that way, especially from those who feel that they themselves hold high principles in comparison with others. Clearly, passions are aroused when deeply-held values are challenged, as the [Guardian article on Peter Seeger](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/nov/06/weekend.kevintoolis) illustrates.

Examples are discussed in the course material to illustrate the point that values depend very much on context. This statement is a call to action, perhaps, talking of moral dilemmas and conflicting values:

> "Our job, as ethical actors, is to identify what they are, and then negotiate how best to instantiate and balance them."

Research is as robust as you'd expect for the social sciences, with this, from a study of a small sample of people (N < 700) in three countries with similar (colonial) cultural pedigree:

> "... people  endorse the  same  values  to  a  similar  extent  across  countries  and  also instantiate  them  similarly." [@Bardi2018]

Not much of a surprise there, given the evolutionary path of the handful of people studied.


### Case studies

Proejct Maven and the Google employee revolt against it is presented as the first case study of how corporations can make choices that do not align with the values of the stakeholders, in this case, the staff. That project sat in stark contrast to Google's ["Don't be evil"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) mantra, still enshrined in its code of conduct (cf. the characterisation of ethics as an escape from regulation by @Hildebrandt2019). The military application of data-driven innovation is clearly compelling, and others are emerging, including [Clearview AI's face recognition app](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html), which [the company](https://clearview.ai/) has worked hard to present as ethical use of technology.
