# Introduction {-}

**TL;DR:** I didn't complete this course because I came upon an impossible obstacle: I lost trust in the course and the presenters in week 4. Skip to the [reflection](#a-reflection).

These are my notes from participation in the Edinburgh Data Ethics MOOC, running in November and December 2020. Any errors here are my own responsibility.

## Course overview {-}

Week 1 Ethics and Law
: What are ethical values? Can we rely on legal regulation? What are the most pressing issues facing data driven industries?

Week 2 Crime and Justice
: Should we use predictive policing and sentencing algorithms? How can biases sneak into such algorithms? How can we remove them?

Week 3 Home and City
: What are the promises of smart homes and cities? How can they impact our privacy and freedom? How can we design them to protect those values?

Week 4 Money and Markets
: Can future tech lead to a world without money? Can algorithms help us fairly distribute resources? How could we design a fair AI?

Week 5 Life and Health
: Should we keep genetic databanks? Would you trust an AI doctor? What are the principles of responsible research and innovation?
